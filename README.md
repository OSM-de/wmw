# wmw - Who Maps Where?

This project aims to help you find a local mapper in an area that you are unfamiliar with.

So, if you really need to know, if the `waste_basket`s on the corner of George St. and Bayard St. in New Brunswick are still in situ, you'd just have to look at [the Map](http://wmw.webmapping.cyou/?map=40.49433,-74.44364&zoom=19) and see who's created that area at his or her local area and contact them ;-)

# I'd love to be on the Map!

This project is based on [the OpenStreetMap Community Index](https://openstreetmap.community) and uses the same feature and resource structure, so, if you'd like to have your home area be displayed:

1. Go To [GeoJSON.io](https://geojson.io) and draw a polygon using the menu on the right hand side of the map.
2. Choose your way of saving that GeoJSON file somewhere, either on your device or directly as a Gist (don't forget to set it public).
3. Create a [new Issue](https://github.com/OSM-de/wmw/issues/new?assignees=kmpoppe&labels=enhancement&template=add-a-new-user-to-the-map.md&title=Add+a+New+User%3A+%5BUSERNAME%5D) using the template provided.

# Credit where it's due

Bryan Housel has done literally all the leg-work in creating the OSM Community Index, which is the basis for this project. Show him a little love, when you come across his work (iD Editor, OSM Community Index, Name Suggestion Index).
